This is what I can do for you for you to be able, you know, to, maximize or enjoy the benefits of the organ. I'll going to extend your pretrial for another 15 days with no charge. So at least you do have a 15 days to enjoy, you know, the amazing product, and then give us a callback, before the end of that 15 day additional or extension period.\n\nTo give us the feedback. Because what I heard from you is that you haven't used the product that much. So you're not, you know, here did not yet get what the benefits of it. So that's the reason why I'm extending your,\n\nSpeaker 1: period or your pretrial\n\nSpeaker 0: for you to be able to enjoy and discover the benefits of as in South Oregon. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. What date would that be?\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Let me care. So your, already extended your pretrial. It will end on August 24th. So you need to give us a callback before August 24th to give us a feedback.\n\nIf you mean, what happened to the product, if it didn't something, you know, it gives you the benefits that you need, but let's say, you love the product. You like the product. You don't need to give us a callback then. Okay? It will be automatically, you will be receiving another bottle for your monthly subscription.\n\nAnd, in onset of a call, I heard that you're not, you know, your, your dealing about the the price, which is $83.86. Right? Okay.

How about that?\n\nSpeaker 1: I I can't I can't afford that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. This is my uh-huh. This is my maximum employee discount. Discount, I'll give it to you.

I could, you know, like, $15. I know that's, you know, but that's\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay, ma'am. Don't worry. That's great. Because I already given you my employee discount of 40%. Right?\n\nSo my supervisor can give you another 40 per cents. So that's an equivalent of 80%. So instead of paying $83.80, what you'll be paying is only $10.76 every month for everybody. How about that?\n\nSpeaker 1: That sounds great.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's great. So, I'm extending your pretrial until August 24th. So after August 24th, you will be charged only $16.76.
