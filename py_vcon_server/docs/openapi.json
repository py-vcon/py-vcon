    "description": "\nThe Python vCon Server installed from the Python py_vcon_server package.\n\nThe vCon server provides a RESTful interface to store and operate on vCons.\nThese vCon operations can be a single one-off operation or can be setup\nto perform repeatable sets of operations on very large numbers of vCons.\n\nOne-off operations are performed via the vCon Storage CRUD entry points.\n\nRepeatable sets of operations can be defined in what is called a pipeline\nvia the Admin: Pipelines entry points.\nA queue is created for each pipeline and then jobs (e.g. vCons) are\nadded to the queue for the pipeline server to perform the set of processors,\ndefined by the pipline, on the vCon\n(see the Admin: Job Queues entry points for queue managment and job queuing).\nProcessors in a pipeline are sequenced such that the\ninput to the first processor is defined in the job from the queue.\nThe first processor's output is then given as input to the second processor\nin the pipeline and so on.  After the last processor in a pipeline has\nbeen run, its output is commited if marked as new or modified.  Many queues,\neach with a pipeline of configured processors can exist in the system\nat one time.  Pipeline servers are configured to watch for jobs in\na specific set of queues.  Consequently, a pipeline server only\nruns processors defined in the pipelines configured in the\npipeline server's configure set of queues.\n\nServers, Job Queues and In Progress Jobs can be monitored via the following entry points:\n\n  * Admin: Servers\n  * Admin: Job Queues\n  * Admin: In Progress Jobs\n\nThis server is built to scale from a simple single server to hundreds\nof pipeline servers.  A server can be configured to provide any one\nor conbination of the following:\n\n  * Admin RESTful API\n  * vCon RESTful API\n  * Pipeline server with configured number of workers\n\nThe open source repository at: https://github.com/py-vcon/py-vcon\n",
